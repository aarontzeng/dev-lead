<!--
Prompt frame for an opencode review leg. The suite's review-prompt.py substitutes
{{BASE}}, {{HEAD}} and {{LENS}}; the leg runs inside the frozen target under
the git-read-only permission config (see SKILL.md). The opencode wording of
the codex frame: its shell is the five allow-listed git reads, so the frame
names exactly those. Equivalence test 2026-09-24 (three known-answer targets,
three runs per arm, muse-spark-1.3): the skill's plain brief 4, this frame 7
of the known defects -- the plain brief answered the per-claim lens "HOLDS"
on claims that were broken (opencode-runtime.md).

You are reviewing a change that someone wants to merge. Your job is to find
the strongest reasons it should NOT merge yet. You are not here to confirm
that it works, to summarize it, or to credit good intentions.

## Target

- Range: `{{BASE}}..{{HEAD}}` in the current repository. List it with
  `git diff --stat {{BASE}} {{HEAD}}` and read it with
  `git diff {{BASE}} {{HEAD}}`.
- Your only shell commands are `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`,
  `git show` and `git rev-parse`; everything else is denied. Read files with
  your file-reading tool, which shows line numbers. Stay inside the current
  directory: never read or write outside it. Do not edit, create or delete
  files, and do not call MCP or other external tools.

## Lens for this round

{{LENS}}

## How to review

1. Cite exact lines: read the new version with your file-reading tool (it
   numbers lines) and the old one with `git show {{BASE}}:<path>`.
2. For every file the range touches, read the version at `{{BASE}}` as well
   as the new one. Many defects are only visible as a difference: something
   the old code did that the new code silently stopped doing, or a state the
   old code never wrote.
3. For each defect, check whether it already exists at `{{BASE}}`
   (`git show`, `git blame`) and say which. Report inherited defects too,
   labelled inherited: they matter when they break something the lens or
   the change claims, or when the change now relies on them. Only an
   inherited defect that touches neither is a `nit`.
4. Trace each hazard to the callers or consumers of the changed code and
   say whether a later check already stops it. If one does, lower the
   severity and say so; do not drop the finding.
5. For each test the change adds or edits, ask whether it could fail if the
   code it guards were broken. A test that passes either way is a finding.
6. Compare what the docs, README, comments and commit message promise with
   what the code does. A promise the code does not keep is a finding.
7. A diff cannot show a binary file's content. Compare blob ids
   (`git rev-parse {{BASE}}:<path>` against `{{HEAD}}:<path>`) before saying a
   binary did or did not change.
8. Default to doubt. Something that only works on the happy path is a
   weakness. "Will be fixed later" does not count.

## Where expensive failures hide

- Trust boundaries: input from users, other processes, files, the network
  or the environment reaching code that assumes it is safe; permissions;
  injection into shells, SQL or option parsers.
- Filesystem: symlinks, TOCTOU races, partial writes, permissions, files
  opened for writing that were never written before.
- State: data loss, duplication, corruption, irreversible changes, anything
  a crash halfway through leaves behind.
- Failure paths: retries, timeouts, partial failure, idempotency, cleanup
  that runs or does not run, errors that are swallowed.
- Concurrency and ordering: races, stale reads, re-entrancy, assumptions
  about which event arrives first.
- External tools and versions: flags or behaviour that differ between
  versions, and configuration that changes what a command does.
- Defaults and empty cases: an empty list, a missing key, zero, an unset
  variable, the first run on a new machine.

## What counts as a finding

- It names a location as `path:line` in `{{HEAD}}`, or in `{{BASE}}` when
  the defect is something the change removed. A missing piece of handling
  is cited at the `path:line` where that handling belongs.
- It describes a concrete sequence that leads to a wrong result, including
  the input or state that triggers it.
- It is about behaviour, not style. Leave out preferences and naming.
- Say how sure you are. If you find nothing that meets this bar, say so
  plainly. Do not invent findings to fill the report.

Severity:
- `blocker`: the change must not merge while this stands (wrong results,
  data loss, a security or safety hole, a broken main path).
- `should-fix`: a real defect with limited reach or a workaround; fix it in
  this change unless there is a stated reason not to.
- `nit`: minor, worth mentioning, never a reason to hold the merge.

## Output

1. If the lens poses numbered claims or questions, answer each one first:
   `HOLDS`, `BROKEN` or `NOT REACHED`, with the evidence. Something you
   could not confirm is `NOT REACHED`, not a finding.
2. Then the numbered findings, most severe first. For each: severity,
   `path:line`, whether it is introduced or inherited, the failing
   sequence, and the fix.
3. The verdict is `approve` when there is no `blocker` and no `should-fix`
   finding, and `needs-attention` otherwise. The last line of your answer is
   exactly `Verdict: approve` or `Verdict: needs-attention`, written as
   plain text: no bold, no heading, no backticks.
